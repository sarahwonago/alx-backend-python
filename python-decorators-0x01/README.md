## Project Description
This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications. Through hands-on tasks, learners will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections, manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results. The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, providing learners with an in-depth understanding of Pythonâ€™s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these tasks, professional developers will:

- Deepen their knowledge of Python decorators and how they can be used to create reusable, efficient, and clean code.
- Enhance database management skills by automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.
- Implement robust transaction management techniques to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.
- Optimize database queries by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.
- Build resilience into database operations by implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
- Apply best practices in database interaction for scalable and maintainable Python applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- SQLite3 database setup with a users table for testing.
- A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.
- Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

## Key Highlights
- Task 0: Logging Database Queries
Create a decorator to log all SQL queries executed by a function.
Learn to intercept function calls to enhance observability.
- Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator
Automate database connection handling with a decorator.
Eliminate boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.
- Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator
Implement a decorator to manage database transactions (commit/rollback).
Ensure robust error handling and data consistency.
- Task 3: Retry Database Queries
Build a decorator to retry database operations on failure.
Introduce resilience against transient database issues.
- Task 4: Cache Database Queries
Implement a decorator to cache query results.
Optimize performance by avoiding redundant database calls.
