# Overview

In modern web applications, performance, modularity, and clean architecture are essential. Django provides powerful tools that help developers build robust and maintainable backend systems. Three core concepts that support these goals are:

- **Event Listeners using Django Signals**  
  Signals allow decoupled parts of an application to communicate by emitting and listening to events. This enables actions like sending confirmation emails or logging activities whenever a specific model action (like saving or deleting) occurs—without tightly coupling that logic to your views or models.

- **Django ORM & Advanced ORM Techniques**  
  Django’s Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) enables developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL. It also provides advanced tools to optimize performance—like `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, and query annotations—helping avoid common issues like the N+1 query problem.

- **Basic Caching**  
  Caching stores frequently accessed data so it can be retrieved faster. Django supports various caching strategies (view-level, template fragment, low-level caching), which can drastically reduce page load time and database load.

Together, these techniques improve application responsiveness, database efficiency, and code scalability, making them crucial tools for Django backend developers.

# Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

- Use Django Signals to decouple side-effects from core business logic.
- Efficiently retrieve and manipulate database data using Django ORM.
- Avoid performance issues through query optimization techniques.
- Implement caching at the view, template, or data level to reduce server workload.
- Write clean and testable backend logic using Django’s built-in tools.

## 1. Event Listeners Using Django Signals

### What are Signals?

Django Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when specific actions have taken place. They’re useful for triggering side effects like notifications, logging, or updates across different parts of your app.

### Common Signals:

- `pre_save` / `post_save`
- `pre_delete` / `post_delete`
- `m2m_changed`
- `request_started` / `request_finished`

### Best Practices:

- Keep signal functions lean and avoid long-running tasks.
- Use the `@receiver` decorator to keep registration clean and explicit.
- Separate business logic from the signal handler—call a service or utility function.
- Disconnect signals during tests to prevent unwanted behavior.

## 2. Django ORM Basics

### 🔧 What is ORM?

The Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) allows interaction with the database using Python models. You can query, insert, update, and delete records using intuitive syntax without writing raw SQL.

### Common Operations:

- **Create**: `Model.objects.create(...)`
- **Retrieve**: `Model.objects.get(...)`, `.filter()`, `.all()`
- **Update**: `.save()`, `.update()`
- **Delete**: `.delete()`

### Best Practices:

- Always catch exceptions like `DoesNotExist` and `MultipleObjectsReturned`.
- Chain `.filter()` to narrow queries instead of retrieving all data.
- Validate data before saving.

## 3. Advanced ORM Techniques

### Tools for Performance:

- `select_related()` – for foreign key optimizations (JOINs).
- `prefetch_related()` – for many-to-many or reverse foreign key optimizations.
- `annotate()` – for aggregations like counts or sums.
- `Q()` and `F()` – for complex queries and field-based calculations.
- **Custom Managers** – to encapsulate and reuse query logic.

### Best Practices:

- Avoid repeated queries with eager loading.
- Use `only()` or `defer()` to limit unnecessary field loading.
- Profile complex queries using Django Debug Toolbar or `.query`.

## 4. Basic Caching in Django

### What is Caching?

Caching stores the result of expensive computations or database queries to avoid reprocessing. Django supports multiple levels of caching, including per-view, per-template-fragment, and manual (low-level) cache APIs.

### Common Tools:

- `@cache_page(60 * 15)` – for view-level caching.
- `{% cache 300 "sidebar" %}` – for template fragment caching.
- `cache.set()`, `cache.get()` – low-level caching.

### Best Practices:

- Don’t cache sensitive or user-specific data unless scoped properly.
- Use cache versioning and meaningful keys.
- Invalidate/update cache upon data changes using signals or explicit logic.
